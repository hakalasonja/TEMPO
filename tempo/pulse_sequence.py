class Pulse_sequence():
    """
    Class for creating sequences or lists of pulses.
    
    A Pulse sequence object stores all pulses applied to a system during a single simulation. If there is a static (time-independent) Hamiltonian that applies throughout the entire simulation, this should be passed to the constructor separately. 
    
    The pulses may be added all at once in a list in the constructor, or they may be added one by one after the initialization of the pulse sequence.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    pulses : list of :obj:`pulse.Pulse` 
        List of :obj:`pulse.Pulse` instances that make up the pulse sequence. Pulses do not have to be ordered in any way.
    Hstat : :obj:`hamiltonian.Hamiltonian` or :obj:`qutip.Qobj`, optional
        Time-independent Hamiltonian that applies at all times in the simulation.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    pulses : list of :obj:`pulse.Pulse`
        List of :obj:`pulse.Pulse` instances that make up the pulse sequence. 
    Hstat : :obj:`qutip.Qobj`
        Time-independent Hamiltonian that applies at all times in the simulation.
